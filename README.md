# Project Title

Password Generator with options for length (from 8 to 128 characters), for selection of character sets 
(lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters), and for specifying minimum amounts of characters 
from each character set for inclusion in password.

## Getting Started

This project is hosted on GitHub at https://rguthrie000.github.io/GuthriePasswordGenerator/
The HTML, CSS, and JS files used for the Password Generator are located at repo
rguthrie000/GuthriePasswordGenerator.  In addition to index.html, the assets\css folder has
reset.css, which is linked from index.html's header.

### Prerequisites

A web browser is required to interpret/run this program.

### Installing

Copy index.html to the desired execution directory.  Also copy the full assets subdirectory 
to the execution directory.  To run, paste the relative link to index.html in the browser URL box,
then execute.

## Running the tests

The Password Generator is easily tested by using its GUI to explore performance against
the requirements.

## Deployment

See Installing, above.

## This page was built with:
VS Code - Smart Editor for HTML and CSS
Google Chrome - browser for display and test
Chrome Inspector - Google Chrome add-on for inspection of page elements

## Versioning
